# Twitch Chat Viz
This is a work-in-progress project which takes data scraped from Twitch VODs with Twitch Chat Downloader (https://github.com/PetterKraabol/Twitch-Chat-Downloader/) and turns it into freq/time data visualizations. This program relies on Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.It currently exists as a Python notebook, but future versions will be executable via command line.
